# About
This repository contains all of the files needed to run my personal website which can be viewed at [retroject.tech](http://www.retroject.tech).
It's mainly a portfolio for my work as a software engineer, but also serves as a way for me to teach myself about web technologies.
Node.JS is the server hosting the site with Pug for the HTML templates.
If you would like to hear my thoughts about designing the server please [watch my video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rXgRgoZiOE).

## Planned Additions
As stated above, I would like to use this as a teaching tool as well so I have a few ideas for things I want to implement.
- Contact Page
  - A page where a user can leave their name, email, message, and message topic.
  - Message Topics will include:
    - Bug Report
    - "Just to say Hi"
    - Professional Contact
    - Request Résumé
  - Use some sort of protection against bots (i.e. reCaptcha or the like)
  - Sends me an email with all of the info
